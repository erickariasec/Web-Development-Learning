/*
    You can use absolute and relative units like px and em in CSS Grid to define the size of rows and columns.
    You can use these too:

    fr: fix the column or row to a fraction of the available space,

    auto: set the column or row to the width or height of its content automatically,

    % - Fits the column or row to the percentage width of its container.


    Here is the code that generates the preview result:

    grid-template-columns: auto 50px 10% 2fr 1fr;


    This line of code generates five columns.
    The first column is as wide as its content, the second is 50px wide, the third is 10% of its container,
    and for the last two columns; the remaining space is divided into three sections: two are assigned to the fourth column and one to the fifth column.

    Make a grid with three columns that have the following width dimensions: 1fr, 100px, and 2fr.
