    To animate an element, you need to know the animation properties and the @keyframes rule.
    The animation properties control how the animation should behave, and the @keyframes rule controls what happens during that animation.
    There are eight animation properties in total.
    This challenge will keep it simple and cover the two most important ones first:

    animation-name sets the name of the animation, which is then used by @keyframes to tell CSS which rules go with which animations.

    animation-duration sets the time of the animation.

    @keyframes is like specifying exactly what happens inside the animation during the duration.
    This is done by giving CSS properties for specific "frames" during animation, with percentages ranging from 0% to 100%.
    If you compare this to a movie, CSS properties of 0% is how the element is displayed in the opening scene.
    CSS properties with 100% is how the element appears at the end, just before the credits roll.
    CSS then applies the magic to transition the element for the given duration to render the scene.
    Here is an example to illustrate the use of @keyframes and animation properties:

    #anim {
        animation-name: colorful;
        animation-duration: 3s;
    }

    @keyframes colorful {
        0% {
            background-color: blue;
        }   
        100% {
            background-color: yellow;
        }
    }

    For the anim id element, the code snippet above sets the animation-name to colorful and sets the animation-duration to 3 seconds.
    Next, the @keyframes rule binds to animation properties named colorful.
    Sets the color to blue at the beginning of the animation (0%) which will turn yellow at the end of the animation (100%).
    You are not limited to just transitions from start to finish, you can set properties for the element to any percentage between 0% and 100%.

    Create an animation for the element with the id rect, setting animation-name to rainbow and animation-duration to 4 seconds.
    Next, declare a @keyframes rule and set the background-color at the beginning of the animation (0%) to blue, the middle of the animation (50%) to green, and the end of the animation (100%) to yellow.
