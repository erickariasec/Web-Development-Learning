/*
    Instead of adjusting the overall background or text color so that the foreground is easily readable,
    you can add a background-color to the element that contains the text you want to highlight.
    This challenge uses rgba() instead of normal rgb() or hex codes.

    rgba means:
    r = network
    g = green
    b = blue
    a = alpha/opacity level
    
    RGB values can range from 0 to 255.
    Alpha value can range from 1, which is completely opaque, or a solid color, to 0, which is completely transparent, or light.
    rgba() is ideal to use in this case, as it allows you to adjust the opacity.
    This means you don't have to completely block out the background.

    You will use background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1) for this challenge.
    Produces a dark gray color that is almost transparent given the low opacity value of 0.1.

    To make the text stand out more, set the background-color of the h4 element to the given rgba() value.

    Also for the h4, remove the height property and add 10px padding.
