/*
    In previous challenges, we saw how to use some of the animation properties and the @keyframes rule.
    Another animation property is the animation-iteration-count which allows you to control how many times you would like to loop through the animation.
    For example:

    animation-iteration-count: 3;

    In this case, the animation will stop after running 3 times, but it is possible to make the animation run continuously by setting that value to infinite.

    To keep the ball bouncing to the right in a continuous loop, change the animation-iteration-count property to infinite.
