div {
    width: 70%;
    height: 100px;
    margin:  50px auto;
    background: linear-gradient(
      53deg,
      #ccfffc,

}
div:hover {
    transform: scale(1.1);
}

/*
    The transform property has a variety of functions that allow it to scale, move, rotate, skew, etc., its elements.
    When used with pseudo-classes like :hover that specify a certain state of an element, the transform property can easily add interactivity to your elements.

    Here's an example to scale the paragraph elements to 2.1 times their original size:

    p:hover {
        transform: scale(2.1);
    }

    Note: Applying a transform to a div element will also affect any contained child elements of the div.

    Add a CSS rule for the hover state of the div and use the transform property to scale the div element to 1.1 times its original size when a user hovers over it.
