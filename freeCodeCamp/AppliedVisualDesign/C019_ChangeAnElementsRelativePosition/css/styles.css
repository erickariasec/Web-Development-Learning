    CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, this is what is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model.
    Block elements automatically start on a new line (think title tags, paragraphs, and divs) while inline elements sit between surrounding content (like images or spans).
    The default layout of elements in this way is called the normal flow of a document, but CSS offers a position property to override it.

    When an element's position is set to relative, it allows you to specify how CSS will move it relative to its current position within the normal flow of the page.
    It is paired with the CSS scroll properties of left or right, and top or bottom.
    These tell how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the element away from where it is normally positioned.
    The following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels away from the bottom:

    p {
    position: relative;
    bottom: 10px;
    }

    Changing an element's position to relative does not remove it from the normal flow;
    other elements around it will still behave as if that element were in its default position.

    Note: Positioning gives you a lot of flexibility and power over the visual layout of a page.
    It's good to remember that no matter the position of the elements, the underlying HTML markup must be organized and make sense when read from top to bottom.
    This is how visually impaired users (who rely on assistive devices like screen readers) access your content.

    Change the position property of h2 to relative, and use CSS offset to move it 15 pixels away from the top where it sits within the normal flow.
    Notice that there is no impact on the positions of the surrounding h1 and p elements.
