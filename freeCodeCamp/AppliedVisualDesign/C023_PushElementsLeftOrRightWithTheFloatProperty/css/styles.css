/*
    The following positioning tool doesn't actually use position, but instead sets the float property of an element.
    Floating elements are removed from the normal flow of a document and pushed to the left or right of their containing parent element.
    It is commonly used with the width property to specify how much horizontal space the floating element requires.

    The given markup would work well as a two-column layout, with the section and aside elements side by side.
    Gives the #left float element of left and #right float element of right.
