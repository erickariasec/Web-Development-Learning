    One of the most popular shapes in the world is the heart shape, and in this challenge you'll create one using pure CSS.
    But first, you need to understand the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements.
    ::before creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element; ::after creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element.
    In the following example, a ::before pseudo-element is used to add a rectangle to an element with class heart:

    .heart::before {
        content: "";
        background-color: yellow;
        border-radius: 25%;
        position: absolute;
        height: 50px;
        width: 70px;
        top: -50px;
        left: 5px;
    }

    For the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to work properly, they must have a content property defined.
    This property is typically used to add things like a photo or text to the selected item.
    When the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements are used to create forms, the content property is still required, but is set to an empty string.
    In the example above, the element with the class of heart has a ::before pseudo-element that produces a yellow rectangle with a height and width of 50px and 70px, respectively.
    This rectangle has rounded corners due to its 25% border-radius and is positioned absolutely 5px from the left and 50px above the top of the element.

    Transform the item on the screen into a heart.
    In the heart::after selector, change background-color to pink and border-radius to 50%.

    It then points to the element with class heart (only heart) and fills the transform property.
    Use the rotate() function with -45 degrees.

    Finally, in the heart::before selector, set its content property to an empty string.
