    This challenge will show the use of pseudo-classes.
    A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors to select a specific state of an element.

    For example, the style of an "anchor" tag can be changed by its hover state using the :hover pseudo-class selector.
    Here is the CSS to change the color of the "anchor" tag to red during the hover state:

    a:hover {
    color: red;
    }

    The code editor has a CSS rule to style all tags black.
    Add a rule so that when the user hovers over the a tag, the color is blue.
