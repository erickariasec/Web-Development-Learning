/*
    For this challenge, you will change the opacity of an animated element so that it gradually fades as it reaches the right side of the screen.

    In the animation shown, the round element with the gradient background moves to the right at the 50% mark of the animation according to the @keyframes rule.

    Point to the element with the id of ball and add the opacity property set to 0.1 at 50%, so that the element fades as it moves to the right.
