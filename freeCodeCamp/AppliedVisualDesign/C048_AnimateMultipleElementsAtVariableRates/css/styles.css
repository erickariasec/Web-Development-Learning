/*
    In the previous challenge, you changed the animation rhythm for two similar animated elements by altering their @keyframes rules.
    You can achieve the same goal by manipulating the animation-duration of multiple elements.

    In the animation that runs in the code editor, there are three stars in the sky that shine at the same speed in a continuous cycle.
    To make them flicker at different rates, you can set the animation-duration property to different values for each element.

    Set the animation-duration of elements with classes star-1, star-2, and star-3 to 1s, 0.9s, and 1.1s, respectively.
