/*
    One way to add texture and interest to a background and make it stand out more is to add a subtle pattern.
    Balance is key, as you don't want the background to stand out too much and take attention away from the foreground.
    The background property accepts the url() function to bind an image to the chosen texture or pattern.
    The link is covered in quotes within the parentheses.

    Using the link https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/imgr/MJAkxbh.png, set the background of the entire page with the body selector.
