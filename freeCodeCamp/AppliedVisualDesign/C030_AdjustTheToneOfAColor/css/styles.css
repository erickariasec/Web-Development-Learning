/*
    The hsl() option in CSS also makes it easy to adjust the hue of a color.
    Mixing white with a pure tone creates a tint of that color and adding black will make a shadow.
    Alternatively, a tone is produced by adding gray or tints and shadows.
    Remember that the 's' and 'l' in hsl() represent saturation and lightness, respectively.
    The saturation percentage changes the amount of gray, and the light percentage determines the percentage of white or black in the color.
    This is useful when you have a base shade that you want, but need different variations of it.

    All elements have a default background-color of transparent.
    Our nav element appears to have a cyan background since the element behind it has a background-color set to cyan.
    Add a background-color to the nav element so that it uses the same shade of cyan, but has 80% saturation and 25% lightness to change its hue and shadow.
