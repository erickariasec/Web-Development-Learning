    By manipulating different selectors and properties, you can make interesting figures.
    One of the easiest shapes to try is the crescent moon.
    For this challenge you need to work with the box-shadow property that applies the shadow of an element,
    along with the border-radius property that controls the roundness of the element's corners.

    You'll create a round, transparent object with a sharp shadow that's slightly off to the side - the shadow is actually going to be the moon shape you'll see.

    To create a round object, the border-radius property must be assigned a value of 50%.

    You may remember from a previous challenge that the box-shadow property takes values ​​for offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, spread-radius, and a value for color, in that order.
    The blur-radius and spread-radius values ​​are optional.

    Manipulate the square element in the editor to create the moon shape.
    First, change the background-color to transparent, then set the border-radius property to 50% to make the shape circular.
    Finally, change the box-shadow property to set offset-x to 25px, offset-y to 10px, blur-radius to 0, spread-radius to 0, and color to blue.
