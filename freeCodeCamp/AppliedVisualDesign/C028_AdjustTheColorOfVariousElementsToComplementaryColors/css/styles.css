    In the complementary colors challenge we saw that by placing two opposite colors on the color wheel, they appear more vivid.
    However, strong visual contrast can be annoying if used on a website and can sometimes make text difficult to read if it is set against a complementary-color background.
    In practice, one of the colors is usually used as the dominant and the complementary colors are used to draw visual attention to certain content within the page.

    This page will use a shade of teal (#09A7A1) as the dominant color and the complementary orange (#FF790E) to highlight the login buttons.
    Change the background-color of the header and footer from black to teal.
    Next, change h2 text color to teal as well. Finally, set the button's background-color to orange.
