/*
    The application of a color in HTML elements is not limited to a flat tone.
    CSS provides the ability to use color transitions, also known as gradients, on elements.
    This is accessed through the background property's linear-gradient() function.
    
    Here is the general syntax:
    background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);

    The first argument specifies the direction from which the color transition starts,
    it can be set as a degree, where 90deg does a horizontal gradient (from left to right) and
    45deg does a diagonal gradient (from bottom left to top right). ).
    The following arguments specify the order of colors used in the gradient.

    Example:
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));

    Use a linear-gradient() for the background of the div element and set it from a direction of 35 degrees to change the color from #CCFFFF to #FFCCCC.
