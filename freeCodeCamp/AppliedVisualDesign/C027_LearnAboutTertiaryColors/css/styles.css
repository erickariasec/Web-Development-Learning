    Monitors and screens create different colors by combining amounts of red, green, and blue light.
    This is known as the additive RGB color model in modern color theory.
    Red (R), green (G) and blue (B) "for its acronym in English" are primary colors.
    Combining two primary colors makes the secondary colors cyan (G + B), magenta (R + B), and yellow (R + G).
    You already saw these colors in the complementary color challenges.
    These secondary colors are the complement of the primary color not used in their creation and are opposite that primary color on the color wheel.
    For example, magenta is made up of red and blue and is the complement of green.

    Tertiary colors are formed by combining two primary colors with one of their secondary color neighbors.
    For example, among the RGB color model, red (primary) and yellow (secondary) form orange (tertiary).
    This adds six colors to a single color wheel for a total of twelve.

    There are several methods to select different colors that result in a harmonious combination in design.
    An example that you can use tertiary colors is the split complementary color scheme.
    This scheme starts with a base color, then pairs it with the two colors that are adjacent to its complement.
    All three colors provide a strong visual contrast in a design, but are more subtle than using two complementary colors.

    Here are three colors created using the divide-complement scheme:

    Color       Hex code
    orange      #FF7F00
    cyan        #00FFFF
    raspberry   #FF007F

    Change the background-color property of the orange, cyan, and raspberry classes to their respective colors.
    Make sure you use the hex codes and not the color names.
