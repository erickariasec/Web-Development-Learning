/*
    There are many ways to alter the number of animations of similar elements with animations.
    So far this has been achieved by applying an animation-iteration-count property and setting @keyframes rules.

    For illustration, the animation on the right consists of two stars, each decreasing in size and opacity by the 20% mark in the @keyframes rule, which creates the twinkling animation.
    You can change the @keyframes rule for one of the elements, so the stars twinkle at different rates.

    Change the animation speed of the element with the class name star-1 by changing its @keyframes rule to 50%.
