/*
    The next option for the CSS position property is absolute, which locks the element in place relative to its parent container.
    Unlike relative position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding elements ignore it.
    The CSS scroll properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust the position.

    One nuance of absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor.
    If you forget to add a position rule to the parent element, (this is usually done using position: relative;),
    the browser will still look up the element hierarchy, ultimately defaulting to the body tag.

    Lock the #searchbar element to the top right of its parent section by declaring its position absolute.
    Give it top and right offsets of 50 pixels each.
