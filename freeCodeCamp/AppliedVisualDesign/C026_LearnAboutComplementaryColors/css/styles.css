    Color theory and its impact on design is a heavy topic and we will only cover the basics in the next few challenges.
    On a website, colors draw attention, provoke emotions and create visual harmony.
    Different color combinations can change the look of a website and it takes extensive planning to decide on a color palette that integrates with our content.

    The color wheel is a useful tool for looking at how colors are related to each other - it's a circle where similar hues are close together and dissimilar hues are far apart.
    When two opposite colors are together on the circle, they are called complementary colors.
    They are characterized because if they are combined, they cancel themselves and create a gray color.
    However, when placed together, these colors appear brighter and produce a strong visual contrast.

    Below are some examples of colors with their hex codes:

    red (#FF0000) and cyan (#00FFFF)
    green(#00FF00) and magenta (#FF00FF)
    blue (#0000FF) and yellow (#FFFF00)

    This is different from the old-fashioned RYB color model that many of us learned in school, which has different primary and complementary colors.
    Modern color theory uses the additive RGB model (as in a computer screen) and the remaining CMY(K) model (as in printing).
    Read here for more information on this complex topic.

    There are many color picker tools available online that have the option of finding the complement of a color.

    Note: The use of color can be a powerful way to add visual interest to a page.
    However, color alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information because visually impaired users may not understand that content.
    This issue will be covered in more detail in Applied Accessibility Challenges.

    Change the background-color property of the blue and yellow classes to their respective colors.
    Notice how the colors look to each other other than when compared to the white background.
