/*
    When elements are positioned to overlap (i.e. using position: absolute | relative | fixed | sticky),
    the element that comes after within the HTML markup will, by default, appear on top of the other elements.
    However, the z-index property can specify the order of how elements are stacked on top of each other.
    It must be an integer (i.e. an integer and not a decimal),
    and elements with higher z-index values will be moved higher up the element stack than those with lower values.

    Add a z-index property to the element with class first (the red rectangle), and give it a value of 2 so that it covers the other element (the blue rectangle).
