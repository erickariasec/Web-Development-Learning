div {
    background-color: blue;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    margin: auto;
}

/*
    Another positioning technique is to center a block element horizontally.
    One way to do this is to set margin to auto.

    This method also works for images.
    Images are inline elements by default, but can be changed to block elements when the display property is set to block.

    Center the div on the page by adding a margin property with a value of auto.
