    Colors have various characteristics such as hue, saturation, and lightness.
    CSS3 introduced the hsl() property as an alternative way to choose a color by directly indicating these characteristics.

    Hue is often thought of as the "color".
    If you imagine a color spectrum with red on the left turning green in the middle and blue on the right, hue is where a color fits along this line.
    In hsl(), hue uses a color wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the color on the wheel is given as a value between 0 and 360.

    Saturation is the amount of gray in a color.
    A fully saturated color has no gray and a minimally saturated color is almost entirely gray.
    This is given as a percentage with 100% saturation.

    Lightness is the amount of white in a color.
    A percentage is given from 0% (black) to 100% (white), where 50% is the normal color.

    Here are some examples of hsl() with normal and fully saturated lighting colors:

    Color              HSL
    red         hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
    hsl         yellow(60, 100%, 50%)
    hsl         green(120, 100%, 50%)
    cyan        hsl(180, 100%, 50%)
    blue        hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
    magenta     hsl(300, 100%, 50%)

    Change the background-color of each div element based on the class names (green, cyan, or blue) using hsl() .
    All three should have full saturation and normal lighting.
