/*
    The repeating-linear-gradient() function is very similar to linear-gradient() with the main difference that it repeats the specified gradient pattern.
    repeating-linear-gradient() accepts a variety of values, but for simplicity, you'll be working with an angle value and color stop values ​​in this challenge.

    The angle value is the direction of the gradient.
    Color stops are like width values ​​that mark where a transition takes place, and are given as a percentage or number of pixels.

    In the example shown in the code editor, the gradient starts with the color yellow at 0 pixels which fades into the second color blue 40 pixels away from the start.
    Since the next color stop is also 40 pixels, the gradient immediately changes to the third green color, which blends into the fourth red color value since it is 80 pixels from the beginning of the gradient.

    For this example, it helps to think of the color stops as pairs where every two colors mix together.

    0px [yellow -- blend -- blue] 40px [green -- blend -- red] 80px

    If every two color stop values are the same color, the mix isn't visible because it's between the same color, followed by a hard transition to the next color, so you end up with streaks.

    Make stripes by changing repeating-linear-gradient() to use a gradient angle of 45deg, then set the first two color stops to yellow, and finally the second two color stops to black.
