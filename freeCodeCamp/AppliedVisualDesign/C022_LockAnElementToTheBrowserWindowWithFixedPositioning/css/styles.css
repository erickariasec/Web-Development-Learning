/*
    The next layout scheme that CSS offers is fixed position, which is a type of absolute positioning that locks an element relative to the browser window.
    Similar to absolute positioning, it is used with CSS hover properties and also removes the element from the normal flow of the document.
    Other elements no longer "know" where it is placed, which may require some layout adjustments elsewhere.

    A key difference between fixed and absolute positions is that an element with a fixed position (fixed) will not move when the user scrolls.

    The navbar in code is tagged with an id of navbar.
    Change its position to fixed, and the offset 0 pixels from the top and 0 pixels from the left.
    After adding the code, scroll through the preview window to see how the navigation stays in place.
