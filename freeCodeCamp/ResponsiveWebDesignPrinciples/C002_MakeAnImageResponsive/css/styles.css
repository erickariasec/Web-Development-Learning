/*
    Making responsive images with CSS is really simple.
    You just have to add these properties to an image:

    img {
        max-width: 100%;
        height: auto;
    }

    The max-width max-width of 100% will make sure that the image is never wider than the container it's in, and the height of auto will keep the image in its original aspect ratio.

    Add the style rules to the responsive-img class to make it responsive.
    It should never be wider than its container (in this case, it's the preview window) and should keep its original aspect ratio.
    After you've added your code, resize the preview to see how your images behave.
