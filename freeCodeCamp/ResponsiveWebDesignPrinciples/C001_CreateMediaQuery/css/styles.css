/*
    Media Queries are a new technique introduced in CSS3 that changes the presentation of content based on different viewport sizes.
    The viewport is the user-visible area of ​​a web page, and is different depending on the device used to access the site.

    Media queries are based on a media type, and if that media type matches the type of device the document is displayed on, the styles are applied.
    You can have as many selectors and styles within your media queries as you like.

    Here's an example of a media query that returns content when the device width is less than or equal to 100px:

    @media (max-width: 100px) {  CSS Rules  }

    and the following media query returns the content when the height of the device is greater than or equal to 350px:

    @media (min-height: 350px) {  CSS Rules  }

    Remember, CSS within media queries is applied only if the media type matches that of the device being used.

    Add a media query, so that the p tag has a font-size of 10px when the device height is less than or equal to 800px.
