/*
    Instead of using em or px to size text, you can use viewport units for responsive typography.
    Viewport units, like percentages, are relative units, but they are based on different objects.
    Viewport units are relative to the viewport dimensions (width or height) of a device, and percentages are relative to the size of the parent container element.

    The four different viewport units are:

    vw (viewport width): 10vw would be 10% of the width of the viewport.
    vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the height of the viewport.
    vmin (minimum viewport): 70vmin would be 70% of the smallest dimension of the viewport (height or width).
    vmax (maximum viewport): 100vmax would be 100% of the largest dimension of the viewport (height or width).

    Here's an example that sets a body tag to 30% of the width of the viewport.

    body { width: 30vw; }

    Set the width of the h2 tag to 80% of the width of the viewport and the width of the paragraph to 75% of the smallest dimension of the viewport.
