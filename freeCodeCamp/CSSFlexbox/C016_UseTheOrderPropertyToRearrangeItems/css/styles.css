/*
    The order property is used to tell CSS the order in which the flex items appear in the flex container.
    By default, the elements will appear in the same order as they come in the source HTML.
    The property takes numbers as values, and negative numbers can be used.

    Add the order CSS property to both #box-1 and #box-2.
    Give #box-1 a value of 2 and #box-2 a value of 1.
