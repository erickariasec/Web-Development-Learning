#box-container {
    display: flex;
    height: 500px;
}

#box-1 {
    background-color: dodgerblue;
    height: 200px;
    flex-grow: 1;

#box-2 {
    background-color: orangered;
    height: 200px;
    flex-grow: 2;

/*
    The opposite of flex-shrink is the flex-grow property.
    Remember that flex-shrink controls the size of elements when the container shrinks.
    The flex-grow property controls the size of elements when the parent container is expanded.

    Using an example similar to the one in the last challenge,
    if one element has a flex-grow value of 1 and the other has a flex-grow value of 3, the one with the value 3 will grow three times as much as the other.

    Add the flex-grow CSS property to both #box-1 and #box-2.
    Give #box-1 a value of 1 and #box-2 a value of 2.
