/*
    So far, all properties in challenges apply to the flex container (the parent of flex elements).
    However, there are several useful properties for flex elements.

    The first is the flex-shrink property.
    When used, it allows an element to collapse if the flex container is too small.
    Elements shrink when the width of the parent container is less than the combined width of all flex elements within it.

    The flex-shrink property takes numbers as values.
    The higher the number, the more it will shrink compared to the other elements in the container.
    For example, if one element has a flex-shrink value of 1 and the other has a flex-shrink value of 3, the one with the value of 3 will shrink three times more than the other.

    Add the flex-shrink CSS property to both #box-1 and #box-2.
    Give #box-1 a value of 1 and #box-2 a value of 2.
