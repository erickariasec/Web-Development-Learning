/*
    The last property for flex elements is align-self.
    This property allows you to adjust the alignment of each element individually, instead of adjusting them all at once.
    This is useful since other common wrapping techniques use the float, clear, and vertical-align CSS properties, which don't work on flex elements.

    align-self accepts the same values as align-items and will override any value set by the align-items property.

    Add the align-self CSS property to both #box-1 and #box-2.
    Give #box-1 a value of center and #box-2 a value of flex-end.
