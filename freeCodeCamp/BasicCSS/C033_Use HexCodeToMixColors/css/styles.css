/*
    Let's review: In hexadecimal code, 6 hexadecimal digits are used to represent the colors, two for the red (R), green (G) and blue (B) component.

    From these three pure colors (red, green, and blue) we can vary the amounts of each color component to create over 16 million different colors!

    For example, orange is pure red mixed with some green and no blue. In hex code, this translates to #FFA500.

    The digit 0 is the lowest number in the hex code, and represents the complete absence of color.

    The digit F is the highest number in the hex code, and represents the maximum brightness.
