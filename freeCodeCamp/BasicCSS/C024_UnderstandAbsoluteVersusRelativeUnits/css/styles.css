/*
    In addition to px, CSS has a variety of length unit options that you can use.

    Absolute units are related to physical units of length.
    For example, in and mm refer to inches and millimeters, respectively.
    Absolute length units approximate the actual measurement on a screen, but there is some variation depending on the screen resolution used.

    Relative units, such as em or rem, are relative to another length value.
    For example, em is based on the font size of an element.
    If you use it to set the font-size property, it is relative to the parent element's font-size.
