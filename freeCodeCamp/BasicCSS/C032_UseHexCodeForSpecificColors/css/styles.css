    We generally use decimals, or base 10 numbers, which use the symbols 0 through 9 to represent each digit.
    Hexadecimal (or hex) numbers are base 16 numbers. This means that they use sixteen different symbols.
    As in decimal numbers, in hexadecimal the symbols 0-9 represent the values from zero to nine.
    Then A,B,C,D,E,F represent the values from ten to fifteen.
    All these symbols together, from 0 to F, can represent a digit in hexadecimal, giving a total of 16 possible values.

    In CSS, we can represent colors using 6 hexadecimal digits, two for the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components.
    For example, #000000 corresponds to the color black, and is also the lowest possible value.
