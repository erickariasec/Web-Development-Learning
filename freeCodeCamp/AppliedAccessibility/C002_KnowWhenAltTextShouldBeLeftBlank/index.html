    In the last challenge, you learned that it is mandatory to include an alt attribute when using img tags.
    However, sometimes images are grouped together with a title that already describes them, or are used just for decoration.
    In these cases the alt text may seem redundant or unnecessary.

    When an image is already explained with text content or doesn't add meaning to a page, img still needs an alt attribute, but can be set to an empty string.
    Here is an example:

    <img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt="">

    Background images also generally fall under the "decorative" label.
    However, they are typically applied with CSS rules, and therefore are not part of the markup language screen reader process.

    Note: For images with a caption, you may still want to include alt text as it helps search engines catalog the content of the image.

    Camper Cat has programmed a skeleton page for the blog part of their website.
    She is planning to add a visual break between the two items of hers with a decorative image of a samurai sword.
    She adds an alt attribute to the img tag and sets it to an empty string.
    (Note that the src image doesn't link to an actual file, so don't worry that spades won't show up on the screen.)
