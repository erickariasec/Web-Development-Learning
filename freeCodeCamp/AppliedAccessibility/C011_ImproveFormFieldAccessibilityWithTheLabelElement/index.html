    The accessibility enhancement with HTML semantic markup applies to the use of appropriate tag and attribute names.
    The next challenges cover some important scenarios using attributes in forms.

    The label tag contains the text for a specific form control element, typically the name or label for a choice.
    This ties the meaning to the element and makes the form more readable.
    The for attribute on a label tag explicitly associates that label with the form control used by screen readers.

    You already learned about radio buttons and their labels in a lesson in the Basic HTML section.
    In that lesson, we placed the radio button input element inside the label tag along with the text label to make the text clickable.
    Another way to accomplish this is by using the for attribute, as explained in this lesson.

    The value of the for attribute must be equal to the value of the id attribute of the control form. For example:

    <form>
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
    </form>

    Camper Cat hopes there will be a lot of interest in its well-crafted blog posts and wants to include an email sign-up form.
    Add a for attribute to the label email that matches the id in its input field.
