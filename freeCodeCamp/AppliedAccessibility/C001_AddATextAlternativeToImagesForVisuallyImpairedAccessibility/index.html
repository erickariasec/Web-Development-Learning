    The alt attribute describes the content of the image and provides alternative text.
    An alt attribute helps in cases where the image doesn't load or a user can't see it.
    Search engines also use it to understand what an image contains in order to include it in search results.
    Here is an example:

    <img src="importantLogo.jpeg" alt="Company logo">

    Visually impaired people rely on screen readers to convert web content to an audio interface. For this reason,
    they will not be able to receive the information if it is only presented to them visually.
    For images, screen readers can access the alt attribute and read its content to provide key information.

    A good alt text gives the reader a brief description of the image.
    You should always include the alt attribute on your images.
    According to the HTML5 specs, this is now considered mandatory.

    Camper Cat is as much a programming ninja as he is a real-life ninja, and he's building a website to share his knowledge.
    The profile picture he wants to use is a display of his skills and should be appreciated by all site visitors.
    Add an alt attribute to the img tag to explain that Camper Cat is practicing karate.
    (The src attribute of this image is not linked to an actual file, so you will be able to see the alt text on the page.)
