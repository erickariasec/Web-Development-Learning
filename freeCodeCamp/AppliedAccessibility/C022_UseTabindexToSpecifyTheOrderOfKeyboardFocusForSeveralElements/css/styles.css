/*
    The HTML tabindex attribute has three different functions related to the keyboard focus of an element.
    When in a tag, it indicates that the element can be focused.
    The value (an integer that is positive, negative, or zero) determines the behavior.

    Some elements, such as links and controls on forms, automatically receive keyboard focus when a user tabs through a page.
    It's in the same order that the elements come in the HTML markup language source.
    This same functionality can be given to other elements, such as div, span, and p, by placing a tabindex="0" attribute.
    Here is an example:

    <div tabindex="0">I need keyboard focus!</div>

    Note: A negative value of tabindex (usually -1) indicates that an element is focusable, but not keyboard accessible.
    This method is typically used to programmatically focus content (such as when activating a div using for a popup), and is beyond the scope of these challenges.

    Camper Cat created a new survey to collect information about its users.
    He knows that input fields automatically get keyboard focus, but he wants to make sure that his keyboard users pause on instructions while they tab to items.
    He adds a tabindex attribute to the p tag and sets its value to 0. Extra: Using tabindex also allows the CSS pseudo-class: focus to work on the p tag.
