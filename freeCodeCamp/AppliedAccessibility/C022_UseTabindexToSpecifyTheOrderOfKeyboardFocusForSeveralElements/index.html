<!--
    The tabindex attribute also specifies the exact tab order of the elements.
    This is achieved when the value of the attribute is set to a positive number of 1 or greater.

    Setting a tabindex="1" will cause the keyboard to focus on that element first.
    It then loops through the sequence of specified tabindex values ​​(2, 3, etc.), before moving on to the default elements and tabindex="0".

    It is important to note that when the tab order is set in this way, it overrides the default order (which is used by the HTML source code).
    This can confuse users who expect to start navigation from the top of the page.
    This technique may be necessary in some circumstances but in terms of accessibility, be careful before applying it.

    Here is an example:

    <div tabindex="1">I get keyboard focus, and I get it first!</div>

    <div tabindex="2">I get keyboard focus, and I get it second!</div>

    Camper Cat has a search field on their Inspirational Quotes page that they plan to place in the top right corner with CSS.
    He wants the input and submit input search form controls to be the first two elements in the tab order.
    He adds a tabindex attribute set to 1 to the search input, and a tabindex attribute set to 2 to the submit input.

    Another thing to note is that some browsers may put it in the middle of the tab order when an element is clicked.
    An element has been added to the page that ensures that it will always start at the beginning of its tab order.
