<!--
    The next HTML5 element that adds semantic meaning and improves accessibility is the header tag.
    It is used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for your main tag and works well with content that repeats at the top of multiple pages.

    header shares the built-in landmark function you saw with main, allowing assistive technologies to quickly navigate to that content.

    Note: The header is designed to be used within the body tag of your HTML document.
    It is different from the head element, which contains the page title, meta information, etc.

    Camper Cat is writing some great articles on ninja training, and wants to add a page for them to her site.
    Change the top div that currently contains the h1 to a header tag.
