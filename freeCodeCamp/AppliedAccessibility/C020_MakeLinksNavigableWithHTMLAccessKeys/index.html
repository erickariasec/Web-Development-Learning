<!--
    HTML offers the accesskey attribute to specify a shortcut key to activate or focus an element.
    Adding an accesskey attribute can make navigation more efficient for keyboard-only users.

    HTML5 allows this attribute to be used on any element, but it is particularly useful when used with interactive elements.
    This includes links, buttons, and form controls.

    Here is an example:

    <button accesskey="b">Important Button</button>

    Camper Cat wants the links around the two blog post titles to have keyboard shortcuts so their site users can quickly navigate to the full story.
    Adds an accesskey attribute to both links and sets the first to g (for Garfield) and the second to c (for Chuck Norris).
