    There are several forms of color blindness or color blindness.
    These can range from having reduced sensitivity to a specific wavelength of light, to being unable to see any color at all.
    The most common way it presents is a reduced sensitivity to detect shades of green.

    For example, if two similar green colors are the color used in the foreground and background of your content, a colorblind user might not be able to tell them apart.
    We can think of nearby colors as those colors that are neighbors or adjacent on the color wheel.
    For this reason, combinations of these colors should be avoided when used to convey important information.

    Note: Some color selection tools available on the Internet include visual simulations of how they would be seen by users with various types of color blindness.
    These are great resources to take advantage of, along with color contrast calculators you can find online.

    Camper Cat is testing different styles for an important button, but the yellow background-color (#FFF33) and the green text-color (#33FF33) are neighboring shades on the color wheel, making them virtually indistinguishable for some colorblind users .
    (Also, since they have a similar brightness level, they do not pass the contrast ratio check). Change the text color to dark blue (#003366) to resolve both issues.
