<!--
    Headings (h1 to h6 elements) are workhorse tags that help provide structure and tagging to your content.
    Screen readers can be configured to read only the titles of a page so that the user gets a summary.
    This means that it is important that the title tags in your markup have semantic meaning and relate to each other, not simply chosen for their size values.

        â€¢ Semantic meaning* means that the tag you use around the content indicates the type of information it contains.
          If you were writing a document with an introduction, a body, and a conclusion, it wouldn't make much sense to put the conclusion as a subsection of the body in your outline.
          It should be its own section. Similarly, the title tags on a web page should be in order and indicate the hierarchical relationships of its content.

    Titles with equal (or higher) rank start new implied sections, titles with lower rank start subsections of the previous one.

    As an example, a page with an h2 element followed by several subsections tagged with h4 elements would confuse a screen reader.
    With six options, it's tempting to use a tag because it looks better in a browser, but you can use CSS to edit the relative size.

    One final point, every page should always have one (and only one) h1 element, which is the main topic of your content.
    This and the other titles are used in part by search engines to understand the topic of the page.

    Camper Cat wants a page on her site dedicated to becoming a ninja.
    Help him fix the headings so that his markup gives semantic meaning to the content and displays the proper parent-child relationships of his sections.
    Change all h5 tags to the appropriate heading level to indicate that they are subsections of h2 tags. Use h3 tags for this purpose.
