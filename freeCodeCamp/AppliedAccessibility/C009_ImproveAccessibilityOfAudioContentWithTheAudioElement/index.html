    The HTML audio element gives it semantic meaning when it contains sound or audio stream content in code.
    Audio content also needs alternative text so that people who are deaf or hard of hearing can access it.
    For this you must have a nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.

    The audio tag supports the controls attributes.
    This shows the default controls for play, pause, among other controls, and supports keyboard functionality.
    This is a boolean attribute so it doesn't need a value, its presence in the tag triggers the setting.

    Here we have an example:

    <audio id="meowClip" controls>
        <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>

    Note: Multimedia content generally has visual and audio components.
    The subtitles and a transcript need to be synchronized so that users who are visually impaired or hard of hearing can access them.
    Generally, a web developer is not responsible for creating subtitles or transcripts but needs to know how to include them.

    It's time to get out of the Camper Cat and meet our fellow Zersiax (@zersiax), an accessibility champion and screen reader user.
    To hear a clip of your screen reader in action, add an audio element after e.g.
    Includes the controls attribute.
    Next, place a source tag inside the audio tags with the src attribute set to https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/screen-reader.mp3 and the type attribute set to "audio/mpeg".

    Note: The audio clip may sound fast and may be difficult to understand, but this speed is normal for screen readers.
