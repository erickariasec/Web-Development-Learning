    Screen readers have several options for what type of content their device reads.
    These options include jumping to reference (or about) items or jumping to main content, or getting a summary of the page in the titles.
    Another option is to listen to the narration of the available links on a page.

    Screen readers do this by reading the link text, or whatever is between the anchor (a) tags.
    Having a list of links that just say "click here" or "read more" doesn't help.
    Instead, use short but descriptive text within a tags to provide more meaning to these users.

    The link text used by the Camper Cat is not very descriptive if taken out of context.
    Move the anchor (a) tags so they wrap the text information about batteries instead of Click here.
