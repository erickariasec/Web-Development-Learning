    HTML5 introduced several new elements that give developers more options while incorporating accessibility features.
    These tags include main, header, footer, nav, article, and section, among others.

    By default, a browser displays these elements similar to the humble div.
    However, using them when appropriate gives your markup additional meaning.
    The tag name can only indicate the type of information it contains, which adds semantic meaning to that content.
    Assistive technologies can access this information to provide better page summary or navigation options to their users.

    The main element is used to wrap (you guessed it) the main content, and there should only be one per page.
    Its purpose is to surround information related to the central theme of your page.
    It is not intended to include elements that are repeated on all pages, such as navigation links or banners.

    The main tag also has an embedded reference feature that assistive technology can use to navigate to the main content quickly.
    If you've ever seen a "Skip to main content" link at the top of the page, using the main tag automatically provides that functionality to assistive devices.

    Camper Cat has some great ideas for their ninja weapons page.
    Help him set up his markup by adding opening and closing main tags between the header and footer (covered in other challenges).
    Keep the main tags empty for now.
