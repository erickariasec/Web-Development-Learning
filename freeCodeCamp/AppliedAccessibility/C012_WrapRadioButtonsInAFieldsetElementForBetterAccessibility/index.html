    The next topic on forms covers the accessibility of radio buttons.
    Each option is given a label with a for attribute bound to the id of the corresponding element as covered in the last challenge.
    Since radio buttons often come in a group where the user must choose one, there is a way to semantically show that the options are part of a set.

    The fieldset tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons to accomplish this.
    It often uses a legend tag to provide a description for the grouping, which screen readers read for each option in the fieldset element.

    The fieldset container and legend tag are not needed when options are self-explanatory, such as gender selection.
    Using label with the for attribute for each radio button is enough.

    Here is an example:

    <form>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>
            <input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one">
            <label for="one">Choice One</label><br>
            <input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two">
            <label for="two">Choice Two</label><br>
            <input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three">
            <label for="three">Choice Three</label>
        </fieldset>
    </form>

    Camper Cat wants information about the ninja level of its users when they sign up for its email list.
    She added a set of radio buttons and learned from our last lesson to use label tags with for attributes for each option.
    Let's go Camper Cat! However, your code still needs help.
    Change the div tag surrounding the radio buttons to a fieldset tag and change the p tag inside it to a legend.
