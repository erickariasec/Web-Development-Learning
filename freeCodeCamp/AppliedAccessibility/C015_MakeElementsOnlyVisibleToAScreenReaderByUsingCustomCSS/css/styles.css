.sr-only {
    position: absolute;

    Have you noticed that all the accessibility challenges applied so far have not used any CSS?
    This shows the importance of using a logical document outline and semantically meaningful tags around your content before introducing the visual design aspect.

    However, the magic of CSS can also improve accessibility on your page when you want to visually hide content intended for screen readers only.
    This happens when the information is in a visual format (such as a graph), but screen reader users need an alternate presentation (such as a table) to access the data.
    CSS is used to place screen reader-only elements outside the visual area of ​​the browser window.

    Here is an example of the CSS rules that accomplish this:

    .sr-only {
        position: absolute;
        left: -10000px;
        width: 1px;
        height: 1px;
        top: car;
        overflow:hidden;
    }

    Note: The following CSS approaches will not do the same:

        • display:none; or visibility: hidden; hide content from everyone, including screen reader users
        • Zero values ​​for pixel sizes, such as width: 0px; height: 0px; remove that element from your document flow, which means screen readers will ignore it
    
    Camper Cat created a really cool stacked bar chart for her training page and put the data in a table for her visually impaired users.
    The table already has an sr-only class, but the CSS rules are not yet complete. Set position to an absolute value, left to -10000px, and both width and height to 1px.
