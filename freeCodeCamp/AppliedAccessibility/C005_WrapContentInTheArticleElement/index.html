    article is another new HTML5 element that adds semantic meaning to your markup.
    article is a sectioner element and is used to wrap self-contained, self-contained content.
    The tag works well with blog posts, forum posts, or news articles.

    Determining whether content can stand alone is usually a judgment call, but you can do a couple of simple tests.
    Ask yourself, if I remove all the surrounding context, would that content still make sense?
    Similarly, for text, would the content stick if it was in an RSS feed?

    Remember that people who use assistive technologies depend on an organized and semantically meaningful markup language to better understand their work.

    Note: The section element is also new to HTML5, and has slightly different semantic meaning than article.
    An article is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically related content.
    They can be used one inside the other, as needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section.
    When there is no relationship between content groups, use a div.

    <div> - groups of content
    <section> - groups of related content
    <article> - independent groups, self-contained content

    Camper Cat used article tags to wrap the posts on her blog page, but forgot to use them at the top.
    Change the div tag to use an article tag.
