<!--
    At the top of your document, you need to tell the browser what version of HTML your page is using.
    HTML is an evolving language, and is regularly updated. Most major browsers support the latest specification, which is HTML5.
    However, older web pages may use older versions of the language.

    You provide the browser with this information by adding the <!DOCTYPE ...> tag to the first line, where the ... part is the HTML version.
    For HTML5, you use <!DOCTYPE html>.

    The ! and uppercase DOCTYPE is important, especially for older browsers. The html is not case sensitive.

    Next, the rest of your HTML code needs to be wrapped in html tags. The opening <html> goes directly below the <!DOCTYPE html> line,
    and the closing </html> goes at the bottom of the page.
