            The a (anchor) elements can also be used to create internal
            links to jump to different sections within a web page.
            Remove Attribute target="blank" because that opens in a new tab
        -->

        <!--
            To create an internal link, you assign the href attribute of a
            link with a # hash symbol plus the value of the id attribute for
            the element you want to link to internally, usually further down
            the page. Then you need to add the same id attribute to the element
            you're binding to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes
            an element.

            For example: 
            <a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
            ...
            <h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>
        -->
        
        <a href="#footer">Jump to Bottom</a> <!--Create internal link-->
