        <h2>Auto Rename Tag</h2>
        <p>Auto Rename Tag is a super useful VS Code extension for web developers. As the names suggest, Auto Rename Tag renames the second tag as the first one is updated and vice versa</p>
        <h2>Bracket Pair Colorizer</h2>
        <p>Bracket Pair Colorizer is an extension that matches corresponding brackets with the same color. Having nested components, functions, objects, etc., in a file, can become confusing with multiple parentheses, brackets, etc.</p>
        <h2>Prettier</h2>
        <p>Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. With more than 38.5k stars on GitHub, it's one of the most popular code formatters available. Having consistent formatting and styling across your code can save a lot of time, especially when collaborating with other developers.</p>
        <h2>Relative Path</h2>
        <p>Relative Path is a great extension for writing import statements. You can easily get the relative path for any file using shortcuts in your workspace. Instead of searching for file's location, you only need the file's name, and the extension will provide the relative path from the current location to that target file.</p>
        <h2>Icons</h2>
        <p>Icons allows you to create descriptive icons to help differentiate between files and folders. This makes your code more visual, so it's easier to work as teams, return to code after some time, or even just make the experience more fun. For example, you could change the color of a default folder icon using the command palette.</p>
